## The first REST framework for Java

Launched in 2005, Restlet Framework was the first open source framework embracing [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)
in the Java world. Since its inception, its Java API has closely matched the concepts and terms of the REST architecture stlye and the HTTP protocol.
It offers powerful and dynamic routing and security features, a unified client and server Java API.

While it can be embedded within a Servlet container, it can also operate as a standalone library with zero mandatory dependency, resulting in a small
footprint, while enabling the development of any RESTful web API or application. It is available in a Java edition compatible with Java SE/EE,
Google App Engine, OSGi and Android environments, as well as in a separate GWT edition.
